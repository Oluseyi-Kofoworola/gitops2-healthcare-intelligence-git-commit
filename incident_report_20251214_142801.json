  "analysis": "1. **Why this commit likely caused the incident:**\n   The commit introduced several security enhancements and new middleware components, which likely increased the computational load on the system. Specifically, the addition of security middleware for CORS and input validation could have introduced additional processing overhead for each request, leading to increased workload latency. The automated security scanning pipeline, if not properly optimized or scheduled, could also consume significant resources, affecting system performance.\n\n2. **What technical changes introduced the problem:**\n   - **Security Middleware**: The new CORS middleware (`services/common/middleware/cors.go`) and input validation utilities (`services/common/validation/security.go`) likely added extra processing steps for each incoming request. These components are essential for security but can increase latency if not efficiently implemented or if they process a high volume of requests.\n   - **Automated Security Scanning**: The `.github/workflows/security.yml` file introduced automated security scans using seven different tools. If these scans are resource-intensive or run too frequently, they could degrade system performance, especially if they overlap with peak usage times.\n   - **Increased Documentation and Audit Processes**: While not directly impacting performance, the comprehensive documentation and audit processes might have led to increased logging or monitoring, which can also contribute to system load if not managed properly.\n\n3. **What the business/patient impact is:**\n   - **Increased Latency**: Higher workload latency can lead to slower response times for healthcare applications, potentially affecting the user experience for both healthcare providers and patients.\n   - **Delayed Access to Critical Information**: In a healthcare setting, timely access to patient data is crucial. Increased latency can delay access to critical information, impacting clinical decision-making and patient care.\n   - **Compliance Risks**: While the changes aimed to improve compliance with HIPAA, SOX, and FDA regulations, the performance degradation could lead to non-compliance with service level agreements (SLAs) related to system availability and response times.\n   - **Operational Costs**: Prolonged performance issues might necessitate additional resources or infrastructure to handle the increased load, leading to higher operational costs.\n\n4. **How to prevent similar issues:**\n   - **Performance Testing**: Before deploying security enhancements, conduct thorough performance testing to understand the impact of new middleware and automated processes on system latency.\n   - **Optimized Scheduling**: Schedule automated security scans during off-peak hours to minimize their impact on system performance. Ensure that these processes are optimized for resource usage.\n   - **Efficient Middleware Implementation**: Review and optimize the implementation of security middleware to ensure they are as efficient as possible. Consider using asynchronous processing where applicable to reduce request handling time.\n   - **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect performance degradation early. This allows for quick response and mitigation before it impacts users.\n   - **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy changes incrementally and monitor their impact on performance. This approach allows for easier identification of problematic components and reduces the risk of widespread issues.\n   - **Capacity Planning**: Regularly review and adjust system capacity to ensure it can handle additional loads introduced by security enhancements without compromising performance.",
