## SLIDE 2: The Problem We Solved
**Visual:** Before/After comparison (red vs. green)

**Before GitOps 2.0:**
- ❌ 8 minutes per commit (manual compliance checks)
- ❌ 30% of commits missing HIPAA metadata
- ❌ 94-minute average incident resolution
- ❌ 200 hours per audit preparation
- ❌ 12% change failure rate

**After GitOps 2.0:**
- ✅ 28 seconds per commit (AI-powered automation)
- ✅ <2% compliance errors
- ✅ 12-minute incident resolution (87% faster)
- ✅ 20 hours audit prep (90% reduction)
- ✅ 3% change failure rate (75% improvement)

**Bottom Line:** Manual compliance is slow, expensive, and error-prone

## SLIDE 14: Q&A Preparation (Speaker Notes)

**Expected Questions:**

**Q: What happens if AI generates incorrect compliance metadata?**
A: Multi-layer validation: (1) AI generation, (2) OPA policy enforcement, (3) Human review for HIGH risk. Historical accuracy: 98.3%. False positive rate: 2.1%.

**Q: Can this work outside healthcare?**
A: Yes, proven patterns apply to any regulated industry (finance, manufacturing, government). Framework is domain-agnostic.

**Q: What if GitHub Copilot changes pricing?**
A: ROI remains positive even at 5x current pricing ($1,900/dev/year). Breakeven: 15x current price.

**Q: Vendor lock-in concerns?**
A: All code is open-source (OPA policies, scripts). Can migrate to alternative AI providers (Claude, local models) in 2-3 weeks.

**Q: Security of AI-generated code?**
A: AI generates *metadata only*, not business logic. All code changes reviewed by humans. Security scans (gosec, FIPS validation) run automatically.
